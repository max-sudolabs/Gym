"""Served-layer token capture for one model call.

Token ids are dropped on the wire for streaming responses (Anthropic
``/v1/messages``, OpenAI chat SSE), so the capture middleware -- which only sees
the streamed bytes -- cannot record them. But the model server holds the
complete response WITH token ids for a moment, just before it synthesizes the
SSE stream. The middleware therefore hands the model server a per-request "token
sink" through a request-scoped ContextVar; the server calls ``capture_tokens``
on its complete response and the sink writes a ``TokenEntry``.

The sink carries the ``model_call_id`` the middleware minted for the same call,
so a captured ``TokenEntry`` joins its ``ModelCallRecord``. Only the middleware
sets a sink (for rollout-correlated, observed calls), so ordinary untagged
traffic captures nothing.
