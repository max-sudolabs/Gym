"""Served-layer token capture for one model call.

Token ids are dropped on the wire for streaming responses (Anthropic
``/v1/messages``, OpenAI chat SSE), so the capture middleware -- which only sees
the streamed bytes -- cannot record them. But the model server holds the
complete response WITH token ids for a moment, just before it synthesizes the
SSE stream. The middleware therefore hands the model server a per-request "token
sink" through a request-scoped ContextVar; the server calls ``capture_tokens``
on its complete response and the sink writes a ``TokenEntry``.

The sink carries the ``model_call_id`` the middleware minted for the same call,
so a captured ``TokenEntry`` joins its ``ModelCallRecord``. Only the middleware
sets a sink (for rollout-correlated, observed calls), so ordinary untagged
traffic captures nothing.

# worker that did not record its parent resolves nothing: parent_call_id stays unset and
# the builder infers the parent from token prefixes instead. Prefix supply, which needs a
# resolved parent, does not fire for those calls. Both degrade rather than break, and
# parent_link_fallbacks reports the rate. The file store is unaffected because it is keyed
# per rollout and appends under a file lock, which holds across processes.
