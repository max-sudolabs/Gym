"""The training-token record and how to pull it off a served response.

A ``TokenEntry`` holds only what a trainer needs from one model call: the exact
prompt token ids the engine ran on, the generated token ids, and one log
probability per generated token. It is deliberately separate from the model-call
capture record used for evaluation (``ModelCallRecord``): the eval record is a
compact request/response summary and never carries token ids, while a
``TokenEntry`` is large and read only when building training data. Keeping them
apart lets eval reads skip the token payloads and lets training token ids move
to a different store later without touching the eval schema.

Both records for the same model call share a ``model_call_id``, so training can
join a ``TokenEntry`` to its ``ModelCallRecord`` when it needs the eval context.
