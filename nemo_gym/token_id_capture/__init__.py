"""Training-token capture: produce, store, read, and source ``TokenEntry`` records.

This is the per-model-call training data path, kept separate from evaluation
capture. The capture middleware sets a per-request token sink; the model server
records a ``TokenEntry`` from its complete response; a trainer reads a rollout's
entries through a ``TokenSource`` and stitches them into a trajectory.

**This package is a leaf.** Importing it must not pull in fastapi, ray, uvicorn,
aiohttp, requests, or torch, because a training framework's inference worker
imports the record, the protocols, and the capture core to write into its own
data plane (see ``protocols.py``). The HTTP read route and the HTTP reader do
need Gym's server stack, so they are deliberately *not* re-exported here --
import ``nemo_gym.token_id_capture.routes`` / ``.reader`` directly from server
code.
