"""Which recorded call does this request continue?

The builder can infer that after the fact, by finding the earlier call whose
token sequence is the longest prefix of this call's prompt. That works, but it
cannot do two things:

- **Resolve a retry.** Capture records a call once the response is assembled,
  including one the client never received, so a harness retry leaves two records
  with the same prompt and different generations. Both are equally valid
  children, so inference has to guess between them.
- **Run before the call.** Inference happens after the rollout. Supplying the
  engine the previous call's exact tokens (so the next prompt extends them by
  construction instead of being re-rendered from text) has to happen *before* the
  request is forwarded, when there is nothing yet to infer from.

This module answers the question at request time instead, using only what the
harness already sends. A harness must echo the conversation to continue it, so
the model-authored turns in a request are the ones we produced: hashing them in
order identifies the call that produced the last one. Nothing is added to the
wire and nothing depends on the harness preserving a field we invented, and
nothing depends on which dialect the harness speaks.

The index is a map keyed by call, not a running cursor, so it is a tree and
forks cost nothing. Two sub-agents branching from one parent both resolve to it
and both get the same prefix -- which is exactly right, and is why the prefix to
supply is ``cum(parent)`` and not ``cum(previous call)``. Entries are added and
never mutated, so concurrent sub-agents cannot corrupt each other's lineage.

    Eviction is oldest-first by insertion, and runs on access rather than on
    write, so the budget is exceeded by at most the single call recorded after
    the last check -- one ``cum_len``, ~4.5 MiB at 131k. A rollout still in
