"""The model server's read route for captured training tokens.

The route is registered on a model server only when training-token capture is
enabled, so a default run exposes nothing. It lets a non-co-located trainer pull
a rollout's ``TokenEntry`` records over HTTP (see ``HttpTokenReader``) instead of
requiring shared-filesystem access to the store.
